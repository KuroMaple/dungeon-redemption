# Dungeon Redemption

##  Project Description
This is a dungeon crawling game made entierly in C++. It uses SFML for graphics.

## Why?
5 years ago I failed a school assignment making a similar game. I wanted to prove to myself that I am a capable developer 
and I adore dungeon crawlers, having grown up on Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. I also love C++ and making games, and thus this projects idea was born.
