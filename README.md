##  Project Description
Dungeon Redemption is a  dungeon-crawling adventure built entirely in C++, powered by SFML for rendering and game logic.
It takes inspiration from the last few years of my life, the ups, the downs, and the breakthroughs.

## Why?
Five years ago, I failed a school assignment to build a game.
Dungeon Redemption is my way of proving to myself how far I’ve come, both as a developer and as a person.
I chose pure C++ because I love the language and wanted to experience game development without the abstraction or overhead of a typical engine. I wanted to suffer a bit for the sake of my craft.

This project is a love letter to my younger self, a testament to resilience, patience, and growth.
