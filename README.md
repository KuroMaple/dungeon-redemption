##  🎮 Project Description
Dungeon Redemption is a handcrafted dungeon-crawling adventure built entirely in C++, powered by SFML for rendering and game logic.
You’ll explore mysterious maps, battle enemies, and uncover secrets — all coded from scratch.

## 💡 Inspiration
Five years ago, I failed a school assignment to build a similar game.
Now, Dungeon Redemption is my way of proving how far I’ve come, both as a developer and as a person.

This project is also a love letter to the dungeon crawlers I grew up with, especially Pokémon Mystery Dungeon.
I’ve always loved C++, game development, and seeing worlds come alive through code, and this project brings those passions together.
